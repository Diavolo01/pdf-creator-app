# PDF Design Tool - Web App

## Overview

This web application allows users to create PDF layouts similar to Canva, where they can add and move images and text around on a selected paper size. Users can customize their design, save their progress as a configuration file, and export the final design as a PDF.

### Key Features:
1. **Select Paper Size**: Users can choose from predefined paper sizes (e.g., A4, A3) or enter a custom size.
2. **Add Images & Text**: Users can add images and text onto the canvas and position them freely.
3. **Adjust Item Size & Position**: Users can resize and move images and text, and also fine-tune their position using input fields for width, height, and XY coordinates.
4. **Export Configuration File**: Users can save the layout, including item positions, dimensions, and paper size, in a configuration file (JSON).
5. **Import Configuration File**: Users can load a saved configuration file and restore the layout to its previous state.
6. **Export to PDF**: Once the design is complete, users can export the layout as a PDF.
